Create wordlists for `diceware`_::

  $ diceware-list -n -l 7776 /usr/share/dict/words
  1-1-1-1-1 a
  1-1-1-1-2 a's
  ...
  1-2-3-5-3 capt
  1-2-3-5-4 cara
  1-2-3-5-5 carl
  ...
  6-6-6-6-3 zoos
  6-6-6-6-4 éclat
  6-6-6-6-5 élan
  6-6-6-6-6 épée

This is not a `diceware`_ implementation, but only a helper to create
appropriate wordlists.

The main target of `diceware-list` is to provide "good"
wordlists. Wordlists are considered "good" if they

- contain enough terms for use with a certain diceware application
  (for instance 6^6 = 7776 terms if used with six six-sided dice)
- contain terms as short as possible (to reduce typing)
- (optionally) contain no words with non-ASCII chars (to enable use
  with non-localized keyboards)
- contain no offending terms

The last topic is hard to solve technically (hints welcome!), but
`diceware-list` can help to follow the other design rules.

The wordlists generated by `diceware-list` are not meant to be kept
secret. You might put them on the internet, publish on facebook or
print them in the New York Times. Instead the security of the
`diceware`_ technique relies on the entropy or (in this case)
"randomness" of your dice, computer, etc.

In other words: Your passphrases will not be safe because of hiding
your wordlist. They will be safe because there are so many possible
combinations of words you can pick from your wordlist. That means:
longer lists are more secure than shorter ones (if really used to full
extent by your source of randomness with `diceware`_), but hidden
lists are *not* more secure than public ones.


Install
--------

Install latest release from pypi_ ::

  (venv) $ pip install diceware-list

or clone repository from github::

  $ git clone https://github.com/ulif/diceware-list.git

Please consider using `virtualenv`_ for deployment.

In an active virtualenv you can install an executable script of
`diceware-list` running::

  (venv) $ python setup.py install
  (venv) $ diceware-list --help
  usage: diceware-list [-h] [-l LENGTH] [-n] [--ascii] [-d SIDES] [-k]
                       [--use-416] [-v]
                       DICTFILE [DICTFILE ...]


Usage
-----

First, you need a file with words as "dictionary". On typical Debian
systems such files can be found in ``/usr/share/dicts/``.

This file can then be fed to `diceware-list` to create a wordlist
suitable for use with diceware.::

  $ diceware-list /usr/share/dict/words
  !
  !!
  !!!
  ...
  alan
  alana
  alar
  ...
  zzz
  zzzz

By default lists of 8192 (=2**13) words are created. This value can be
changed with the `-l` option.

With `-n` you can tell `diceware-list` to put numbers into each line,
representing dice throws [#]_ ::


  $ diceware_list -n -l 7776 /usr/share/dict/words
  1-1-1-1-1 !
  1-1-1-1-2 !!
  ...
  1-2-3-5-3 alan
  1-2-3-5-4 alana
  1-2-3-5-5 alar
  ...
  6-6-6-6-5 zzz
  6-6-6-6-6 zzzz

The `--ascii` option filters terms out, that contain non-ASCII
characters. This can help in generating non-english word lists that
are usable with regular english keyboards.

The verbose option `--verbose` can be given multiple times to increase
verbosity.

See `--help` for other options.

`diceware-list` follows loosely the recommendations given on
http://diceware.com/ by Mr. Reinhold.


Testing
-------

In a clone of the sources, you can run tests like this::

  (venv) $ python setup.py test

This command will download all required packages, especially
`py.test`_.

You can also install `py.test`_ manually with `pip`_::

  (venv)$ pip install pytest
  (venv)$ pip install -e .

and afterwards, run tests like so::

  (venv)$ py.test

If you also install `tox`::

  (venv)$ pip install tox

then you can run all tests for all supported platforms at once::

  (venv)$ tox


Coverage
--------

To get a coverage report, you can use the respective `tox` target::

  (venv)$ tox -e cov

Or you use the common `coverage` tool::

  (venv)$ pip install coverage
  (venv)$ coverage run setup.py test
  (venv)$ coverage report --include="diceware_list.py,libwordlist.py"


.. [#] The wordlist length in this case should be
       ``(number-of-sides-per-dice)`` powered to
       ``(number-of-dicethrows)``, for instance 6**5 = 7776 for five
       six-sided dice or a single six-sided dice thrown five times.
